# THIS IS THE MAIN CODE, we compile our final code here, our indivisual workspaces are backstage, this is frontstage
# This is a branch, I branched to edit the original skeleton while preserving it, and once satisfied with updated skeleton, I merge update into original. Simple.

# Import libraries


# Introduce yaself to data, size, length, width, distribution, dreamy blue eyes et al.


# Data munging. Lottttta stuff:
# Missing data
# Straight up wrong data (2 instances)
# Convert weirdly syntaxed data into normal floats
# Create new columns from above for DD and AN
# Categorical Data definition
# ANything else y'all think goes here? 


# Oh and, featture selection, a whole new can of worms
# Feature Extraction
# STraight up Feature Synthesis from either
#                                         Multiple feature combination
#                                         Single Feature manipulation


# Correlation map
# Scatter Matrix and stuff


# Research on each feature and their individual IRL importance to data
# Alongwith VIF et al.

# Okay and that should be it for now
