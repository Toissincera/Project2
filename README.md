Project2

(Our final product is Code1.1_FINAL or project2.ipynb and opens with Colab or Jupyter, not Spyder or Notepad or browser.)

For our first Github project, and btw its more complicated because we are collaborating, lets start slow and simple.

Click on Code1.1_Uzman and thats what we can work on as 'main,' so like the finished thing. Like the front stage of a play

I made everyone their work sections and we can work on your code there. Write, execute, debug, chill. No judgement.

When you feel a section of your code is ready, just Whatsapp me and I'll add that part. Simple.

Ideally, GitHub offers forking and merging - integrated tools for this very thing. We'll skip that for next week.

If you have any questions, remember we are a team. Like....Avengers, but way less cool. Let's get frustrated about our bugs together.

[NOTE] If you wanna quickly go back to main page, click <> Code. Remember to save as you work.

Cheers, Uzman
